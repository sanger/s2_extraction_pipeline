How to use components

Selection Page
--------------

This component allows the barcodes of new tubes to be scanned. It should be created with a seed model, which should contain just a user id and a batch number. The batch number should be undefined.

The selection page will pass a 'done' message to it's parent if a user clicks on the 'next' button on the page.
